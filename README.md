# PgrPcTool
**Currently WIP**

PgrPcTool is a tool to bring keyboard/mouse to games running to any emulator focus for the game Punishing: Gray Raven.

## Old PgrPcClient
The old `PgrPcClient` will be deprecated and here my reasons:
* The project is really tied with Windows API's, wich give problems to port to other platforms
* Im not really happy with the current code wrote there, so instead of just refactoring everything, it will just be better to start from 0, reusing
lines of code from `PgrPcClient` project.

Of course, if you still wish to use `PgrPcClient`, the code will still be available under the `pgr-pc-client-windows` branch, but I will not be updating it anymore.
